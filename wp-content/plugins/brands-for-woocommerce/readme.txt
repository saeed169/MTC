== Installation ==
Important: First of all, you have to download and activate the WooCommerce plugin, because without it Brands for WooCommerce cannot work without it.

1. Unzip the downloaded .zip file.
2. Upload the Brands for WooCommerce folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `Brands for WooCommerce` from Plugins page.

= Configuration =
Brands for WooCommerce will add a new sub-menu item called "Brands" in the "WooCommerce" menu. There you will be able to access the plugin settings page.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it compatible with all WordPress themes? =
Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are simply too many themes. Generally, if themes are developed according to the WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, BeRocket plugins are sure to be compatible with them.

= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =
If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, follow these preliminary steps first:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that your plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you to solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as fast as possible. Thanks!
